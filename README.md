# icloud-browser

A stupidly simple launcher to access iCloud for your Debian/Ubuntu desktop as a web app.

This was simply written for convenience and starts a chromium web app and adds the launcher to your application menu. And that is all it does.

# building or installing the debian package

The lazy way (the package is in the repo)

```
sudo apt install dist/icloud-browser_0.1-2_all.deb
```

If you have debhelper installed build your own with

```
fakeroot debian/rules binary
```
